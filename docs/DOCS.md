# Docs
This is an explanation of what the files in this folder are for

### Proposal
this file is the description of what we wanted to do with this project, not all of the goals were completed. We were planning on making a battleship AI, but we realized that with the time we had, we were only able to make the base game, and make it look nice

### Specifications
This is the project description, describing what the professor wanted us to do, and what was required. We have a UML diagram in google docs, which I may update to put on github in the future

### Notes
This repository doesn't have any of the old commits for anonimity reasons, but it will include any future changes that are made
